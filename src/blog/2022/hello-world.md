# Whats this for?

The aim of this was really to just share what I learn in the realm of technology within my personal and professional career. I try to undertake personal projects and I plan on using this blog to provide context for the projects that I create as well as provide context and remind myself of how to achieve certain outcomes from code. 

Professionally, I may write about some interesting tech that I am getting involved with.

# Who am I?

I'm a recently graduated Software Engineer from Robert Gordon University working with a US based payment processor: Payroc. I have been working as a professional Software Engineer since December 2020. Before graduating university, I worked part time at Aldi. 

I have a passion for anything relating to technology, building things and understanding why they are built in their specific ways is something that I have always enjoyed and the tools that I can use through code. 

Most importantly, I love to learn. It's what drives a lot of us to start to code and its what drove me. Learning how to build my first web page, or that feeling of squashing that really annoying bug has always excited me!

# What kinds of tech do I use?

If you have seen my home page, you will know the basics of the technology that I use. However, going into more detail I mainly build personal projects in JavaScript stacks - mainly because I learned to build web projects in JS stacks at uni. 

My favoured frontend framework is VueJs, I find it incredibly easy to build UIs in it as it blends the power of Angular2 with React. Recently I have spent some time messing about with some smaller frameworks like AlpineJS, HTMX and HyperScript.

For my backend development stack, I favour NodeJs with ExpressJS, I have been trying to experiment with NestJS but I havent gotten round to coming up with an idea to start learning it yet. 

Database wise I feel that I am pretty handy with SQL - I have worked with several flavours, MS-SQL, PGSQL. For more light hearted and quick projects I use MongoDB as its way less strict schema-wise.

Professionally, I'm a .NET developer, right now I work on mainly legacy code with the likes of ASP.NET WebForms as the framework. I also work with a touch of MVC here and there too. 

I hope that this blog will help you build a project, or answer a question that you might have when building something.
